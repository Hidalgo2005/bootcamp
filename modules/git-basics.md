# Git Basics

## Targets

Skills to earn, improve or refresh:
 - git: init, add, commit, checkout, branch, merge, push, pull
 - documentation: MarkDown 

## Learn or refresh

Skip any topic or section you feel yourself confident in.

1. Pass [Version Control with Git](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/)
   at Udacity to learn or refresh:
   - What is Version Control?
   - Create a Git Repo
   - Review a Repo's History
   - Add Commits To a Repo
   - Tagging, Branching, Merging
   - Undoing Changes
   
   You may resort to subtitles/closed captions and
   to auto-translated subtitles in particular if you feel
   it would help you to digest the video course better.

2. Complete following levels at https://learngitbranching.js.org/
   - Main: Introduction Section
   - Remotes: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes
3. Markdown is a simple syntax to create nicely formatted 
   technical documentation with ease. It is support by GitHub,
   GitLab and Bitbucket. Check and bookmark for your future reference
   [MarkDown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Feel free using automated caption translation in videos
and Google Translate for textual information.

## Do

Time for little practice. We shall establish a repo
to try your git and github skills in this and some further
course modules.

1. On GitHUb under https://github.com/py-gang organization create a repo
   named `daybook-<your_github_username>`.
   If you do not have sufficient privileges then under your own github
   account create a repo named `py-gang-course`.
   GitHub will suggest adding `README.md`. **Do not** do this. We need
   an empty repo. 
1. Clone the repo locally.
1. Create `README.md` in the project root and complete it using
   MarkDown markup notation:
   - Add `# PyGang Course` title.
   - Add `## Git Basics` module title.
   - Describe 2 or 3 things that
     * were new to you
     * were familiar but you have seen them at a different angle
     * were not so easy to master or comprehend

Any of your writings above can be done in a language you
feel most comfortable with.

If you find some topic not sufficiently disclosed in any
materials, just, let us know.

## When completed

When done let others know you have passed this module.

This lets other know your progress and probably someone
will ask you for some help in this module.

Where to communicate? In a chat you come here from :)

Now you are ready to proceed to 
[Git Collaboration](./git-collaboration.md)
